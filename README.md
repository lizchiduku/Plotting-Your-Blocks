I duplicated a block image by adjusting the CSS code that was provided. 
By Using margins and paddings to adjust, i recreated larger image.
Plotting blocks is a great way of visualizing different elements on the blocks of various colors.
Adjusting the bigger blocks first and then the smaller ones makes it easier for proper arrangement
